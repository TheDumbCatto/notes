Information model can be referred to representations of the constraints, rules or relationships between things/kinds of things - most likely these are concepts or concrete data objects that would be used for the system of which the model is the blueprint.

The model is usually a diagram created using a formal language/syntax like [UML](UML.md) and illustrates data semantics.
