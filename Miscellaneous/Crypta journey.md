### Day 1 (14/06)
- Collected some resources for learning and training
- Listed out mathematical stuff that could be important (for breaking crypto challenges in CTF) **\[1\]**
- Reading the overview of block ciphers and AES **\[2\]**

**Resources**

\[1\] Real analysis, complex analysis (Finite mathematics/Set theory) → Abstract algebra, Linear algebra → Topology & Geometry → Algebraic topology, algebraic geometry → Number theory. Elliptic curves (Group theory, Arithmetics of abelian varieties), Information theory, Combinatorics

\[2\] Crypto101

### Day 2 (15/06)
- Continue reading AES **\[1\], \[3\]**
- Got to know [Key stretching](Key%20stretching.md) **\[2\]**
Admittedly, I didn't do much today. Woke up late and had a coffee session in the afternoon w/ my best bud, which means no work was done.

**Resources**

\[1\] Crypto101

\[3\] [AES Python implementation](https://github.com/boppreh/aes/blob/master/aes.py)


### Day 3 (16/06)
- Continue reading AES **\[1\] \[2\]** (haven't entirely finished, moving on still)
- Read a bit more in **\[1\]**, reaching Stream cipher
