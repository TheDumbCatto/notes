### SUMMARY/CONCLUSION

Serotonin and dopamine have a significant role in the pathophysiology of the occurrence of psoriasis, and psychological stress can affect psoriasis through its influence on serotonin and dopamine.

There were **significant differences in serotonin, dopamine, and stress index levels** between groups with psoriasis and non-psoriasis (102.68 ± 25.44 Vs. 154.17 ± 20.90; p < 0.001), (437.13 ± 164.83 Vs. 138.11 ± 89.51; p < 0.001), and (138.5 ± 27.80 Vs. 92.55 ± 42.97; p < 0.001). **Significant negative correlation was found between serotonin level and stress index** (r = -0.366; p = 0.016) **and between serotonin and dopamine** (r = -0.634; p < 0.001) but a **positive correlation was found between dopamine and stress index** (r = 0.459; p = 0.042). Serotonin and dopamine showed that it could be used as a biochemical predictive model for psoriasis (AUC > 0.7)
